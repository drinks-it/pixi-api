# How to contribute
We are always glad to receive contributions and patches from the community. There are just a few guidelines that we want contributors to follow.

## Coding Standards
All contributions must follow [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) coding standard.

# Code
Bugfixes, breaking features and major improvements should be sent into `dev`.

# Tests
Check [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to learn how to run and write internal tests. We want to encourage you to write tests for patches you are implementing. If this doesn't seem possible, such PRs are stil valid and can be accepted.
